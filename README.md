# Transcend
Essentially, a transformer is a deep learning model that comprises an encoder and a decoder, leveraging attention mechanisms to identify crucial elements within sequential inputs. Using '[Attention is all you need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)' by Vaswani et al. as the foundation, Transcend constructs all compenents of a transformer model from scratch to build a neural machine translation model. The model is trained to act as a sentence based English to French translator.

## Attention is all we need 
The attention mechanism lies at the core of the transformer model. Using this mechanism, the transformer eliminates the need for using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) that come with their own set of limitations.
